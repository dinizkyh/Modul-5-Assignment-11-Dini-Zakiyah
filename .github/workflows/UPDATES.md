# GitHub Actions Updates - Deprecated Actions Fixed

## Changes Made

### ✅ Updated Deprecated Actions

**Issue:** GitHub Actions workflow was using deprecated versions of actions that will stop working.

**Fixed Actions:**

1. **`actions/upload-artifact`** 
   - ❌ `@v3` (deprecated)
   - ✅ `@v4` (updated)

2. **`codecov/codecov-action`**
   - ❌ `@v3` (deprecated) 
   - ✅ `@v4` (updated)

### 📁 Files Updated

1. **`.github/workflows/test.yml`**
   - Updated `codecov/codecov-action@v3` → `@v4`
   - Updated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `@v4`
   - Added `token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}` for authentication

2. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**
   - Updated `codecov/codecov-action@v3` → `@v4`
   - Added `token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}` for authentication
   - Fixed YAML formatting issues

### 🔧 Additional Improvements

- **Token Authentication:** Added Codecov token support for better reliability
- **YAML Formatting:** Fixed indentation issues in ci.yml
- **Future-Proofing:** Updated to latest stable versions

### 📋 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Codecov Token:** 
   - Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add secret: `CODECOV_TOKEN` with your Codecov project token
   - (This is optional - workflows will work without it but may have rate limits)

2. **Test Workflows:**
   - Commit and push these changes
   - Verify workflows run successfully
   - Check that coverage reports are uploaded

### 🚀 Benefits

- ✅ **No More Deprecation Warnings:** All actions use current versions
- ✅ **Future Compatibility:** Won't break when v3 actions are removed
- ✅ **Better Performance:** v4 actions have improved performance and features
- ✅ **Enhanced Security:** Latest actions include security improvements

### 📊 Workflow Status

All three main workflows are now using up-to-date actions:

- **`tests.yml`** ✅ (Simple test runner)
- **`test.yml`** ✅ (Multi-version testing)  
- **`ci.yml`** ✅ (Complete CI/CD pipeline)

The workflows will continue to:
- ✅ Run tests on every push to any branch
- ✅ Generate and upload coverage reports
- ✅ Enforce coverage thresholds
- ✅ Provide security scanning
- ✅ Post coverage comments on PRs
